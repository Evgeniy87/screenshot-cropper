The idea of this script is to make screenshotting your monitor more efficient.\
The default key for the screenshot is [Print Screen key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Print_Screen).

After hitting the __PtrSc__ key you will Have 2 options:
* __Croping__- need to make 2 __Left__ clicks with the mouse like you try to crop or select your section out of the screen.\
like you would use in a picture editing program.
* __Full screenshot__- just 1 __Right__ click

Save as window will pop up for saving you cropped/full-screen shot.\
